# Story 1.3: Share a join link

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a player,
I want to share a join link,
so that players can join the pool without manual setup.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given a pool exists, when I request an invite link, then the system generates a unique pool invite link, and I can copy the link for sharing.
2. Given the invite link is opened by an unauthorized user, when they access the link, then the system directs them into the pool join flow, and it does not expose commissioner-only data.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement the user-facing flow or domain update (AC: #1)
- [ ] Add server-side validation and persistence where applicable (AC: #1, #2)
- [ ] Surface explicit status, confirmation, or failure messaging in the UI (AC: #1, #2)
- [ ] Add deterministic tests for the rules touched by this story (AC: #1, #2)

## Dev Notes

- Use Next.js App Router patterns only; route files live under `src/app`.
- Keep mutations in server actions or route handlers; no sensitive writes from client components.
- Keep Supabase wiring isolated to `src/lib/supabase/*`.
- Keep scoring and lock logic in shared pure TypeScript domain logic.
- Preserve visible freshness and lock-state messaging; never present stale data as current.
- Keep tests deterministic at the domain level, especially for scoring and lock behavior.
- App Router + TypeScript strictness + Tailwind are the baseline stack.
- Server-backed state must remain the source of truth for auth, deadlines, and scoring.
- Polling-based leaderboard refresh with explicit freshness indicators is required.
- Accessibility and mobile responsiveness are first-class constraints.
- Trust cues must be visible: lock state, freshness, confirmation, fallback states.
- Commissioner flows should feel like a guided launch sequence.
- Player flows must be mobile-friendly with immediate pick counts and confirmation.
- This story maps to Epic 1: Launch and manage a private pool.

- Keep the implementation aligned to the existing App Router / Supabase split.

### Project Structure Notes

- Align with `src/app` for routes and `src/lib` for domain logic and data wiring.
- Keep story-specific UI near the route segment when it is clearly scoped.
- Preserve existing naming and avoid introducing a new architectural pattern for a single story.
