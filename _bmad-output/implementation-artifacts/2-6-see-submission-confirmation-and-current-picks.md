# Story 2.6: See submission confirmation and current picks

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a player,
I want to see submission confirmation and current picks,
so that I know my entry was saved correctly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given I submit a valid entry, when the save completes, then the system shows a clear confirmation state, and it shows my current picks, and the confirmation is immediate and unmistakable.
2. Given I return to the pool later, when I view my entry, then I can see my saved picks and whether they are locked or editable, and the locked or editable state is explicit.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement the user-facing flow or domain update (AC: #1)
- [ ] Add server-side validation and persistence where applicable (AC: #1, #2)
- [ ] Surface explicit status, confirmation, or failure messaging in the UI (AC: #1, #2)
- [ ] Add deterministic tests for the rules touched by this story (AC: #1, #2)

## Dev Notes

- Use Next.js App Router patterns only; route files live under `src/app`.
- Keep mutations in server actions or route handlers; no sensitive writes from client components.
- Keep Supabase wiring isolated to `src/lib/supabase/*`.
- Keep scoring and lock logic in shared pure TypeScript domain logic.
- Preserve visible freshness and lock-state messaging; never present stale data as current.
- Keep tests deterministic at the domain level, especially for scoring and lock behavior.
- App Router + TypeScript strictness + Tailwind are the baseline stack.
- Server-backed state must remain the source of truth for auth, deadlines, and scoring.
- Polling-based leaderboard refresh with explicit freshness indicators is required.
- Accessibility and mobile responsiveness are first-class constraints.
- Trust cues must be visible: lock state, freshness, confirmation, fallback states.
- Commissioner flows should feel like a guided launch sequence.
- Player flows must be mobile-friendly with immediate pick counts and confirmation.
- This story maps to Epic 2: Join and submit picks on mobile.

- Keep the implementation aligned to the existing App Router / Supabase split.

### Project Structure Notes

- Align with `src/app` for routes and `src/lib` for domain logic and data wiring.
- Keep story-specific UI near the route segment when it is clearly scoped.
- Preserve existing naming and avoid introducing a new architectural pattern for a single story.
