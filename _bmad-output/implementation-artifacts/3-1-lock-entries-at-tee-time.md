# Story 3.1: Lock entries at tee time

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a commissioner,
I want to lock entries at tee time,
so that no one can change picks after the tournament starts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given the lock deadline has not passed, when I view entries, then they remain editable.
2. Given the lock deadline passes, when the system evaluates the pool, then it locks all eligible entries, and it marks them as locked everywhere they appear.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement the user-facing flow or domain update (AC: #1)
- [ ] Add server-side validation and persistence where applicable (AC: #1, #2)
- [ ] Surface explicit status, confirmation, or failure messaging in the UI (AC: #1, #2)
- [ ] Add deterministic tests for the rules touched by this story (AC: #1, #2)

## Dev Notes

- Use Next.js App Router patterns only; route files live under `src/app`.
- Keep mutations in server actions or route handlers; no sensitive writes from client components.
- Keep Supabase wiring isolated to `src/lib/supabase/*`.
- Keep scoring and lock logic in shared pure TypeScript domain logic.
- Preserve visible freshness and lock-state messaging; never present stale data as current.
- Keep tests deterministic at the domain level, especially for scoring and lock behavior.
- App Router + TypeScript strictness + Tailwind are the baseline stack.
- Server-backed state must remain the source of truth for auth, deadlines, and scoring.
- Polling-based leaderboard refresh with explicit freshness indicators is required.
- Accessibility and mobile responsiveness are first-class constraints.
- Trust cues must be visible: lock state, freshness, confirmation, fallback states.
- Commissioner flows should feel like a guided launch sequence.
- Player flows must be mobile-friendly with immediate pick counts and confirmation.
- This story maps to Epic 3: Follow live standings with trustworthy scoring.

- Keep the implementation aligned to the existing App Router / Supabase split.

### Project Structure Notes

- Align with `src/app` for routes and `src/lib` for domain logic and data wiring.
- Keep story-specific UI near the route segment when it is clearly scoped.
- Preserve existing naming and avoid introducing a new architectural pattern for a single story.
